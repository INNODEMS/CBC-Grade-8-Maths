        <p>
            A fraction is a number that represents a part of a whole. Fractions are made up of two numbers: a numerator and a denominator. 
            The numerator is the number on top and the denominator is the number on the bottom. 
            The numerator represents the number of parts you have and the denominator represents the total number of parts in the whole.
