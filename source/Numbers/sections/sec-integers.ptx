    <introduction>
         <p>
            <term>Integers</term> are a fundamental concept in mathematics with wide applications
            in real-life situations. In sports and games, points, scores, and 
            rankings are often represented using integers. In Grade <m>7</m>, 
            you learned about whole numbers. In this section, we will take 
            a step further to explore <term>integers</term>.
