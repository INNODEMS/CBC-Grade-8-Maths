    <title>Squares and Square Roots</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
           Learners use squares and square roots to determine unknown lengths in triangular shapes using the pythagorean theorem,  calculating areas and designing structures that require precise measurements.

        <p>
            Akinyi, a Grade <m>8</m> student, uses squares and square roots to calculate the size of her family's vegetable garden. 
            Her parents want to create a square garden with an area of <m>36</m> square meters.
            To find the length of each side of the garden, Akinyi calculates the square root of <m>36</m>, which is <m>6</m> meters. 
            This helps her family know exactly how much fencing they need to enclose the garden i.e <m>4 \times 6 = 24</m> meters of fencing.
