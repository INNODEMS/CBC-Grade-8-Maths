    <title>Squares and Square Roots</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
        Akinyi, a Grade <m>8</m> student, uses squares and square roots to help her family plan their vegetable garden. Her parents want to create a square garden with an area of <m>36</m> square meters. To determine the length of each side, Akinyi calculates the square root of <m>36</m>, which is <m>6</m> meters. This allows her family to know they need <m>4 \times 6 = 24</m> meters of fencing to enclose the garden.

        Squares and square roots are essential tools in solving real-world problems. Learners use them to calculate unknown lengths in triangles using the Pythagorean theorem, find areas, and design structures that require precise measurements.
