        <p>
            A square is a number that is the product of a number multiplied by itself. 
            For example, 4 is a square because 2 multiplied by 2 equals 4. 
            The square of a number is written using the exponent notation. 
            The square of a number is the number raised to the power of 2. 
            For example, the square of 4 is written as --- and is equal to 16.
