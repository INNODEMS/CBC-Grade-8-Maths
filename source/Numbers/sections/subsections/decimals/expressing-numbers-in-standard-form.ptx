    <title>Expressing Numbers in Standard Form</title>
    <p>
        <alert>Standard form</alert> is a way of representing numbers in a clear and consistent way. 
        A number expressed in the form of <m>p \times 10^n</m>,
        where <m>n</m> is an integer and <m>p</m> is greater than zero but less than <m>10 </m> is said to be in standard form.

                        <p>
                            To express <m>5679</m> in standard form, we start by writing the first digit of the number.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first digit of <m>5679</m> is <m>5</m>. 
                            We then place a decimal point after it and write the remaining digits, giving <m>5.679</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we moved the decimal point <m>3</m> places to the left, we multiply by <m>10^{3}</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, the standard form of <m>5679</m> is <m>5.679 \times 10^{3}</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>0.000712</m>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To express <m>0.000712</m> in standard from, we start by identifying
                            the first non-zero digit
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first non-zero digit in <m>0.000712</m> is <m>7</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, we place the decimal point immediately after <m>7</m>, giving <m>7.12</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we shifted the decimal point <m>4</m> places to the right,
                            we express this as an exponent of <m>-4</m> with base <m>10</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, the standard form of <m>0.000712</m> is <m>7.12 \times 10^{-4}</m>.

                        <p>
                            <m>1236.9721</m>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To express <m>1236.9721</m> in standard form, we begin by identifying the first non-zero digit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first non-zero digit in <m>1236.9721</m> is <m>1</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, we place the decimal point immediately after <m>1</m>, giving <m>1.2369721</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we shifted the decimal point <m>3</m> places to the left, we express this as an exponent of <m>3</m> with base <m>10</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, the standard form of <m>1236.9721</m> is <m>1.2369721 \times 10^{3}</m>.
