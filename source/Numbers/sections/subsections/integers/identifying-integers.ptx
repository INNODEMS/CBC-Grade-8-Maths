    <title>Identifying Integers in Different Situations</title> 
    <!-- <p>
        <term>Integers</term> are a fundamental concept in mathematics with wide applications
        in real-life situations. In sports and games, points, scores, and 
        rankings are often represented using integers. In Grade <m>7</m>, 
        you learned about whole numbers. In this section, we will take 
        a step further to explore <term>integers</term>.
