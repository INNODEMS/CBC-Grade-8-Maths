    <title>Identifying integers</title>
    <p>
        <term>Integers</term> are a fundamental concept in mathematics with wide applications
        in real-life situations. In sports and games, points, scores, and 
        rankings are often represented using integers. In Grade <m>7</m>, 
        you learned about whole numbers. In this section, we will take 
        a step further to explore <term>integers</term>.

        <term>Integers</term> are set of positive numbers, 
        negatives numbers and zero.

                    All <term>whole numbers</term> are integers, 
                    but not all integers are whole numbers because 
                    integers also include negative numbers.

                    Integers do not include fractions or decimals.
