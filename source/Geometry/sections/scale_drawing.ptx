    <title>Scale Drawing</title>

    <p>
        A scale drawing is a drawing that represents an object or structure at a smaller or larger scale than the actual object. 
        Scale drawings are used in many different fields, including architecture, engineering, and art. 
        They are useful for showing how an object will look when it is built or created, and they can help to communicate ideas and designs to others.
