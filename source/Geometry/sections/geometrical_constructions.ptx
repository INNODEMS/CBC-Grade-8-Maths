    <title>Geometrical Constructions</title>

    <p>
        Geometrical constructions are a way of creating geometric figures using only a compass and a straightedge. 
        These constructions are based on a set of rules that allow you to create figures such as lines, angles, 
        and polygons with a high degree of accuracy.
