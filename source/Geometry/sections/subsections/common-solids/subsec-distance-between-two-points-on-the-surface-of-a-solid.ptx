    <title>Distance between two points on the surface of a solid</title>
    <p>
        The distance between two points on the surface of a solid is the shortest distance between the two points along the surface of the solid. 
        This distance can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
