    <title>Models of compact solids </title>
    <p>
        Compact solids are three-dimensional objects that do not have any empty spaces inside them. 
        These solids are often used in geometry to represent real-world objects such as buildings, vehicles, and furniture. 
        Some common examples of compact solids include cubes,cuboids, pyramids, cylinders and cones.

    <p>
        In the previous sections, you made models of hollow cubes, cuboids and cylinders. How did  ?

    <p>
          In this section , you will make models of cubes ,cuboids and cylinders using clay or plasticine.
