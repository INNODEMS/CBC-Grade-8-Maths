        <title>The net of a cylinder</title>
        <p>
            In the previous section, you identified a cylinder. Discuss what to look for when identifying a cylinder.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this section, you will sketch nets of a cylinder.
        </p>

        <p>
            A cylinder has 3 faces. Two faces are circles and one face is a rectangle. A net of a cylinder is made up of 2 circles and 1 rectangle.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                             Use the MOVE tool Toolbar Image to move the Unfold or Fold Net slider. This will show how the cylinder can be turned into a net. A net is created by imagining that you cut and unfold the 3-D shape into one, flat shape.

                        <p>
                             Using the same slider, the net can be folded back into the original 3-D shape.
