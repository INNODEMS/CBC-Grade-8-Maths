    <title>Models of hollow solids (1)</title>
    <p>
        Hollow solids are three-dimensional objects that have empty spaces inside them. 
        These spaces can take on a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the type of solid. 
        Some common examples of hollow solids include pipes, tubes, and cylinders. 
        In this section, we will explore some of the basic properties of hollow solids and how they can be used in geometry.
