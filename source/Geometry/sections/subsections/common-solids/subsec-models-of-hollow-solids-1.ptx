    <title>Models of hollow solids </title>
    <p>
        Hollow solids are three-dimensional objects that have empty spaces inside them. 
        These spaces can take on a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the type of solid. 
        Some common examples of hollow solids include pipes, tubes, and cylinders.

    <p>
        In the previous section, you sketched nets of cubes ,cuboids,cylinders,pyramids and cones.How did you do it?
        In this section , you will make models of cubes ,cuboids,cylinders,pyramids and cones from their nets.
