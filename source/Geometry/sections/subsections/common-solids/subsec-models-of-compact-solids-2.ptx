    <title>Models of compact solids (2)</title>
    <p>
        Compact solids are three-dimensional objects that do not have any empty spaces inside them. 
        These solids are often used in geometry to represent real-world objects such as buildings, vehicles, and furniture. 
        Some common examples of compact solids include cubes, prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, and spheres. 
        In this section, we will explore some of the basic properties of compact solids and how they can be used in geometry.
