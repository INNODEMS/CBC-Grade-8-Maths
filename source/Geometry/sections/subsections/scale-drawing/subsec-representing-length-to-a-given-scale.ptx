    <title>Representing length to a given scale</title>
    <p>
        Representing length to a given scale involves creating a proportional representation of real-world measurements, typically in drawings, maps, or models.
    </p>
    <p>
        A scale is a ratio that compares the dimensions of a representation (like a drawing) to the corresponding dimensions of the actual object. It indicates how much smaller or larger the representation is compared to reality.

        <statement>
            <p>
                The length of a school field is measured as <m>12000</m>cm. Given that <m>1</m>cm represents <m>600</m>cm, represent the length of the school field on paper.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Actual length of a school field = <m>12000</m>cm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scale = <m>1</m>cm represents <m>600</m>cm.

            <p>
                <m>\frac{12000}{600}=20</m>cm
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the scale length is <m>20</m>cm
            </p>
        </solution>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The height of a mountain is 3,500 meters. If we use a scale where 1 cm represents 500 meters, represent the height of the mountain in your workbook.
            </p>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Actual height of the mountain = <m>3500</m> meters
            </p>
            <p>
                Scale = <m>1</m>cm represents <m>500</m> meters
            </p>
            <p>
                To determine the height on paper:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\frac{\textbf{Actual height }}{\textbf{Scale factor}}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                = <m>\frac{3500}{500} = 7</m>cm
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the height of the mountain would be drawn as 7 cm tall on paper.
