    <title>Coordinates and Graphs</title>

    <p>
        In geometry, we often use coordinates and graphs to represent and visualize 
        geometric objects and relationships. Coordinates are pairs of numbers that 
        represent the position of a point in space, and graphs are visual representations 
        of geometric objects and relationships. In this section, we will explore how 
        coordinates and graphs can be used to represent and solve geometric problems.
