    <title>Common Solids</title>

    <p>
        In geometry, a solid is a three-dimensional object that occupies a volume of space. 
        There are many different types of solids, each with its own unique properties and characteristics. 
        Some of the most common solids include cubes, prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, and spheres. 
        In this section, we will explore some of the basic properties of these solids and how they can be used in geometry.
