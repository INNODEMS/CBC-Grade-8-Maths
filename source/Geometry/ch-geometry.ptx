    <title>Geometry</title>

    <p>
        Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and 
        relationships of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. 
        It is a fundamental part of mathematics and has many practical applications 
        in everyday life. In this chapter, we will explore some of the basic concepts 
        of geometry and how they can be used to solve problems and answer questions.
