    <title>Linear equations</title>

        You are planning resume for the next terms session in your school. You need to buy exercise books and a mathematical set. The cost of one exercise book is Ksh <m>50</m>, and a mathematical set costs Ksh <m>200</m>. If you have a total of Ksh <m>450</m> to spend, how many exercise books can you buy for your school work?
    </p>

        In this situation we need to form an equation to determine the number of exercise books. We can represent the number of books as <m>b</m> and write the total cost as:
    </p>
    <p>
        <me>
            50 b + 200 = 450
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore we can say, a <m>linear</m> <m>equation</m> is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between numbers and an unknown value using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding how to form and solve linear equations allows us to make better decisions and solve practical challenges efficiently.
