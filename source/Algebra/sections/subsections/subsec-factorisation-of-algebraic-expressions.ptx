    <p>
        Factorization is the process of breaking down an algebraic expression into simpler factors that, when multiplied, give back the original expression. It helps simplify expressions, solve equations efficiently, and understand relationships between quantities. By identifying common factors, we can express algebraic terms in a more compact form, making calculations easier.
