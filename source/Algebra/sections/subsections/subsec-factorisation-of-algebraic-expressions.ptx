        <term>What is Factorization?</term>
    </p>
    <p>
        Factorization is the process of expressing an algebraic expression as a product of its simpler components, making it easier to simplify and solve mathematical problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        It helps simplify expressions, solve equations efficiently, and understand relationships between quantities. By identifying common factors, we can rewrite algebraic terms in a more structured form, making problem-solving more efficient.

    <p>
        <term>a) Factorization by Finding Common Factors</term>
    </p>
    <p>
        This method involves identifying the greatest common factor (GCF) in all terms of an expression and factoring it out.
    </p>
    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Factorize: <m>8 x + 12</m>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            The greatest common factor (GCF) of <m>8 x</m> and <m> 12 </m> is <m> 4 </m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <m> 4 </m> divides <m>8 x</m> and <m> 12 </m> to get;
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                4(2 x + 3)
            </me>
        </p>
    </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
        <term>b) Factorization of Algebraic Expressions by Grouping</term>
    </p>
    <p>
        This technique is useful when an expression has four terms that can be grouped into pairs, each having a common factor.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Factorize <m>ax + ay + bx + by</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Group the terms (like terms) which look similar
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>(ax + ay) + (bx + by)</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Factor out common terms in each group:
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>a(x + y) + b(x + y)</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Factor out the common factor <m>(x + y)</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    (x + y)(a + b)
                </me>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
        <term>New word;</term> like terms
    </p>
    <p>
        Like terms are terms that have the same variable and the same power. They can be added or subtracted because they belong to the same group.

            Work in groups of 3-4 learners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make number cards from papers (Manilla or foolscap) e.g [** A photo of paper number cards(different colours) with an expression like <m> xy </m> , <m> mn^2 </m> **]
        </p>
        <p>
             Use the number and variable cards to create algebraic expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Identify the common factor in each expression and rewrite it in factored form.
