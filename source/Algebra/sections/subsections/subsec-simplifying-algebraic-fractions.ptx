    <title>Simplifying algebraic fractions</title>
    <p>
        Algebraic fractions are fractions that have algebraic expressions in their numerators,in denominators or with them.

                A mechanic workshop has two workers, Amani and Baraka. Amani completes <m>frac {1}{3}</m> of a car repair job in an hour, while Baraka completes <m>frac {1}{4}</m> of the same job in an hour.

                Taking any given letter to represent the total amount of work, find:

                We can simplify algebraic fractions the same way we simplify numerical fractions

                Now, simplify;

        Sometimes we simplify fractions with l<m>ike terms</m> and sometimes <m>unlike terms.</m>
    </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Simplify the algebraic expression, <m>frac {3}{4} a + frac {5}{6} b</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Find the LCM of the denominators
            </p>
            <p>
                The denominators are <m>4</m> and <m>6</m>, getting <m>12</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Rewrite each fraction with denominator <m>12</m>:
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    frac {3}{4} a + frac {5}{6} b = frac {9a + 10b}{12} 
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the terms are unlike (one has <m>'a'</m> and the other has <m>'b'</m>), we cannot combine them, therefore;
