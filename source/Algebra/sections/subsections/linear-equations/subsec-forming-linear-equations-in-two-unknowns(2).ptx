    <title>Forming Linear Equations in Two Unknowns</title>
  
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In many real-life situations, we encounter problems involving two related unknown quantities. When we represent such problems using algebra, we form equations with two variables. These are known as linear equations in two unknowns, often written in the form <m>ax + by = c</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To form such equations, we assign variables to the unknowns, then use the information given to write two related expressions and connect them with an equals sign.

      <title>Examples of Forming Linear Equations</title>
      
      <example>
        <title>Forming equations from money and quantity</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A fruit vendor sells oranges at Ksh 10 each and mangoes at Ksh 20 each. On a certain day, she sold a total of 50 fruits worth Ksh 800. Form two linear equations to represent the situation.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Let <m>x</m> be the number of oranges and <m>y</m> be the number of mangoes.</p>
          <p>Equation for total fruits: <m>x + y = 50</m></p>
          <p>Equation for total cost: <m>10x + 20y = 800</m></p>
        </solution>

        <title>Forming equations from age relationships</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The sum of Mary and her brother's ages is 30. Mary is 4 years older than her brother. Form linear equations in two unknowns.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Let Mary's age be <m>x</m> and her brother's age be <m>y</m>.</p>
          <p>Equation for total age: <m>x + y = 30</m></p>
          <p>Mary is 4 years older: <m>x = y + 4</m></p>
