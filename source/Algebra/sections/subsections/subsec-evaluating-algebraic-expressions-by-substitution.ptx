    <title>Evaluating algebraic expressions by substitution</title>
    <p>
        We often deal with formulas and expressions on our day-to-day calculations. For example, calculating the total cost of items, determining the speed of a moving object, or finding the area of a piece of land. These formulas use letters (variables) to represent unknown values. In this section, we will learn how to evaluate algebraic expressions by replacing variables with given numbers.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                <m>Naree</m> Bus company charges <m>60 m + 150</m> shillings for a trip to town, where <m>m</m> is the number of kilometres travelled. Find the total cost for a <m>7 km</m> trip.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Here we are given <m>m</m> = <m>7</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore,
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    
                60 m + 150 = 60 (7) + 150
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    = 420 + 150
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    = 570 shillings
                </me>
            </p>

                            Given that a bunch of <m>Sukuma</m> <m>wiki</m> goes for <m>10</m> shillings, a <m>gorogoro</m> of maize for <m>50</m> shillings and a tomamto for <m>5</m> shillings, find the total amount paid by the customer for all the goods.

    <example>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                To solve the question, we need to substitute the values of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> into the expression;
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>a</m> = 5, <m>b</m> = 3 and <m>c</m> = 7;

            <p>
                <me>
                    = 3(5) + 2(3) - (7)

                <me>
