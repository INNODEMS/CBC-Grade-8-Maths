  <title>Algebra</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In daily life, we often deal with changing quantities like the cost of items, distance travelled, or time taken. Algebra helps us represent such situations using expressions, so that we can calculate, predict, and make decisions more easily.

      In this topic, you will build on what you learned in Grade 7. You will:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Learn how to break down algebraic expressions using factorization.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Simplify more complex algebraic fractions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Accurately evaluate expressions by substituting values into them.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also explore how technology tools like <m>\textbf{GeoGebra}</m> can help you solve and visualize algebraic expressions in a fun and interactive way.
