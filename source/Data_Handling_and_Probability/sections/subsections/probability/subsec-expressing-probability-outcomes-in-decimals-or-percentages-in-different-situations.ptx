    <title>Expressing probability outcomes in decimals or percentages in different situations</title>
    <p>
        Probabilities can be expressed as fractions, decimals (between 0 and 1), or percentages (0% to 100%), each offering a different perspective on the likelihood of an event, with decimals and percentages being useful for easy comparison and understanding

        <m>\textbf{Key points about expressing probability outcomes in decimals or percentages}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Percentages: Represent the probability as a percentage between 0% and 100% (e.g., 25% for a 25% chance).
    </p>
    <p>
        Decimals: Represent the probability as a decimal value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.25 for a 25% chance). A decimal can be converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100.
