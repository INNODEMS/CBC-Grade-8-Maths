    <title>Writing experimental probability outcomes in different situations</title>
    <p>
        Writing experimental probability outcomes" means recording the results of an experiment by noting how many times a specific event occurred out of a total number of trials essentially expressing the probability of that event happening based on the actual data collected during the experiment, rather than theoretical calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's usually written as a fraction, decimal, or percentage where the numerator is the number of times the event occurred and the denominator is the total number of trials.

                    Unlike theoretical probability, which relies on mathematical calculations, experimental probability is based on the actual outcomes observed in an experiment.

                    To write an experimental probability, you divide the number of times the event occurred by the total number of trials.

        Suppose you spin a spinner seven times and the arrow stops at <m>3</m> four times:
    </p>
    <p>
        The experimental probability that the arrow will point to <m>3</m> is given by:
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Probability}</m><m>(3)</m> = <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, <m>\textbf{experimental probability}</m> = <m>\frac{\textbf{number of outcomes}}{\textbf{total number of trials'}}</m>
    </p>
