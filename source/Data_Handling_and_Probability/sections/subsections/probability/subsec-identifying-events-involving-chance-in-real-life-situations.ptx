    <title>Identifying events involving chance in real life situations</title>
    <p>
        Identifying events involving chance in real life situations means recognizing occurrences where the outcome is not guaranteed and depends on random factors,
        like flipping a coin (heads or tails), rolling a dice (getting a specific number), weather forecasting (probability of rain), or drawing a specific card from a deck - essentially, situations where there are multiple possible outcomes with varying likelihoods.
