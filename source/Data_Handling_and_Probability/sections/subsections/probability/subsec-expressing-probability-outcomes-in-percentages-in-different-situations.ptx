    <title>Expressing probability outcomes in percentages in different situations</title>
    <p>
        Probability can be expressed as a percentage to show how likely an event is to occur. A probability percentage tells us the chance of an event happening out of 100.

                <p>
                    A probability of <m>0</m>% means the event cannot happen.

                <p>
                    An event with a probability of <m>50</m>% has an equal chance of occurring or not occurring.

                <p>
                    A probability of <m>100</m>% means the event will definitely happen.
