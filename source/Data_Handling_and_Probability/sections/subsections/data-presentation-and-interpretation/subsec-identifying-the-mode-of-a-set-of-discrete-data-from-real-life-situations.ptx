            <m>5, 7, 8, 10, 7, 6, 7, 9, 8, 7, 6, 9, 10, 7, 8, 9, 7, 6, 8</m>

        The mode of a data set is the value that appears most frequently.

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A shoe store recorded the shoe sizes of 30 customers who bought shoes. The sizes are:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>38, 40, 42, 39, 41, 40, 38, 42, 43, 40, 41, 39, 42, 40</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                <m> 38, 41, 39, 42, 40, 41, 38, 39, 42, 40, 41, 39, 42, 40, 38, 41</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a frequency table for the shoe sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Find the mode of the data set.
