                Mama Karisa went to Shinyalu market to buy fruits and placed them in a basket. 
                The fruits were: Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Grapes, Mangoes, Pineapples, Passion and Avocado.
                A bar graph representing the information is given below. 
                Use the information from the bar graph to answer the questions.
