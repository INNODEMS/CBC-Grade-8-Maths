        A decimal is a number that is written in the base-10 place-value system. 
        The decimal point separates the whole number part from the fractional part of the number. 
        The decimal point is read as "and" when reading a decimal number. For example, the decimal number 3.25 is read as "three and twenty-five hundredths."
