    <introduction>
        <p>
            Probability refers to the likelihood of a specific event happening. 
            It is calculated by dividing the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, essentially expressing how likely something is to occur in a given situation, often using simple experiments like flipping coins or rolling dice to illustrate the concept.

        <p>
            For example, we use probability to predict outcomes in a match, elections, and treatment.
