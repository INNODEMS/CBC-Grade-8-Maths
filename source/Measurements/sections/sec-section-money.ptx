        <p>
            We use money to buy items and pay for services. We can also invest 
            money in banks to earn intrest. Knowledge of money helps us to know whether assets increase 
            or decrease in value to inform our investment decisions. This knowledge also helps us to make 
            decisions on the best offer when buying goods on credit. The figure below shows people seeking
            services related to money from a bank.
