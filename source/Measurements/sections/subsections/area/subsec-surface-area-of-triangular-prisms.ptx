        In the previous classes, you calculated the area of a squares, rectangels and triangles. How did yo do it?
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, You will learn how to determine the surface area of a triangular prism.

                A <m>\textbf{triangular prism}</m> is a three-dimensional 
                shape with two triangular faces and three rectangular faces.
            </p>
            <p>
                It belongs to the family of prisms and has a 
                total of <m>5</m> faces,  <m>9</m> edges, and <m>6 </m> vertices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The figure below shows the triangular prism.
