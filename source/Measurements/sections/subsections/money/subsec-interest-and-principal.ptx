                    Mr. B aya needed Ksh, <m>100\,000</m> to expand his business. He 
                    visited his bank for a loan. The bank manager advised him on terms and conditions for accesing a loan. 
                    He was given the loan on condition that he repays the whole amount at the end of one year and pay a charge of Ksh. <m>10\,000</m>.

                    Being that Mr. Baya needed Ksh. <m>100\,000</m> from the bank. It implies that he will borrow 
                    the total amount of Ksh. <m>100\, 000</m>. Therefore;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Principal is Ksh. <m>100\,0000</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After he has been given a loan, he is required to repay the loan with addition of Ksh. <m>10\,000</m>. This means that Mr. Baya is required to pay an interest. 
                    Therefore;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interest is Ksh. <m>10\, 000</m>.
