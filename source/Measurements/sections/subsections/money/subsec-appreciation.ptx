    Appreciation ðŸ“ˆ

   Appreciation means the increase in value of something over time. For example, if you buy a piece of land for Sh. 5,000 and after a few years it is worth Sh. 7,000. It has then  appreciated in value.

          <m>\textbf {Nyali:}</m> Yeah. How much money did you spend in constructing this magnificient house?</p>
          <p><m>\textbf {Kavai:}</m> I spent 1.2 million including purchasing the piece of land.

          <m>\textbf {Nyali:}</m> How do you intend to pay back that some of money you spent?</p>
          <p><m>\textbf {Kavai:}</m> I'm planning to rent the smaller apartments for Ksh. 50,000 per month.

          <m>\textbf {Nyali:}</m> Wow that's a brilliant idea. </p>
          <p><m>\textbf {Kavai:}</m> Sure that's why I invested in building it. Besides I will not be rentimmg I'l be staying in this house.

      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\textbf {Nyali:}</m>I have also noticed that the value of property in this area appreciates at 10% per annum due to prescence of social amenities. So maybe some later time you can sell the house and recover the money you spent constructing the house and earn a profit.</p>
         <p> <m>\textbf {Kavai:}</m> That's a brilliant idea. I'll think about it .

      From the conversation, calculate the value of the house in 3 years?

<example>

  <statement>
    <p>
      A plot of land's value in 2020 was at Sh. 1 200 000. The value of the plot ppreciated at a rate of 10% per annum in the first year,  12% per annum in the second year,  15% per annum in the third  year,  20% per annum in the forth year and 25% in the fifth year. Calculate the value of the land at the end of the 5th year.
     </p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    <p>
      Value after Appreciation = principal + (rate <m>\times</m> principal)
    </p>
