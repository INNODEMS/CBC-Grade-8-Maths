        <p>
            <m>\textbf{Simple intrest(I)}</m> is the interest calculated only on the initial amount of money, called the principal, over a period of time at a fixed rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The principal <m>P</m> is the original amount of money invested or borrowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rate (<m>R</m>) is the percentage of the principal charged as interest per year. It is usually expressed as a percentage per annum (<m>\textbf{P.A}</m>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The time (<m>T</m>) is the duration for which the money is invested or borrowed, typically measured in years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The formula for calculating simple interest is:
