    Depreciation ðŸ“‰

     Depreciation is the decrease in value of something over time. For example, if you buy a car for Ksh. 10,000 and after a few years it is worth only Ksh. 6,000, it has depreciated in value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depreciation = Value goes down ðŸ“‰

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A car is purchased for Ksh.720,000.
        It is assumed to depreciate by 25% in the 1st and 2nd  year, 20% in the third and fourth year
        and 15% in each of the 5th and above years.
        Calculate the value of the car after 6 years
