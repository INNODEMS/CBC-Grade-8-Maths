Identifying Integers in Different Situations      Work in groups       Choose a starting point on a level ground.    From the starting point, take three steps to the right, marking each step.    Return to the starting point and take six steps forward to the right, marking each step.    From the starting point take four steps to the left, marking each step.    Consider the starting point as , assign a positive sign to steps taken to the right direction and assign a negative sign to the steps taken to the left direction.    Compare your results with other groups' results and discuss what you observed.          Integers are set of positive numbers, negatives numbers and zero.           All whole numbers are integers, but not all integers are whole numbers because integers also include negative numbers.    Integers do not include fractions or decimals.

  "body": " Fractions   A fraction is a number that represents a part of a whole. Fractions are made up of two numbers: a numerator and a denominator. The numerator is the number on top and the denominator is the number on the bottom. The numerator represents the number of parts you have and the denominator represents the total number of parts in the whole.    Combined operations involving addition and subtraction.  To perform combined operations involving addition and subtraction of fractions, follow the steps below:     Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions i.e for .        Find the LCM of the denominators if the fractions have different denominators. The LCM is the smallest number that both denominators can divide into.     Rewrite the fractions so that it has the same denominator i.e.         Once the fractions have the same denominator, you can perform the addition or subtraction of the fractions e.g., for addition case:     For subtraction case ,then:        Simplify the result if the numerator and denominator have any common factors, by dividing both by their GCD.      Cheruto is helping a chef prepare a recipe for a grade end year celebration cake. The ingredients of the recipe are:  Flour: of a cup  Sugar: of a cup  Butter: of a cup  Milk: of a cup  1.

She bought m of white cloth and m of black cloth. The tailor used m of the cloths to make the skirt. Calculate the total length of the cloths that remained.    From the above information, lets write an expression.   m + m - m  Then, convert mixed numbers to improper fractions.   m + m - m  Applying order of operations, we perform addition:   m + m  LCM of and is hence     Next we rewrite the expression and perform subtraction.   m - m  Since the LCM of and is then,     The fraction m cannot be simplified further therefore we convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.   m      Work out the following fraction:       First, find the LCM of the denominators, that is LCM of and which is .  Then using the LCM perform the operations starting from addition followed by subtraction.             Combined operations involving multiplication and division.  Following order of operations, we perform division first then multiplication .  To perform division of Fractions:     Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction (flip the numerator and denominator of the second fraction).    Example :Given , then          To perform multiplication of Fractions:  Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. Simplify the result if possible.  Example:   Simplify by dividing the denominator and the numerator by we get: .      1. Working in groups of , use numbers from to to create proper fractions each.  A proper fraction has a numerator smaller than the denominator e.g .  2. Write down all the fractions formed by each member and discuss as a group if they are all proper fractions.  3.

Division of fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal i.e.     Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by :     Now multiply the result by ​:     Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by :     Therefore,   b) For   Divide by first.     Rewriting the expression we have: .  Performing multiplication:      Hence       A farmer has acres of land. He plans to plant corn on of the land, and then divide that portion into plots of acre each. How many plots of corn can the farmer plant?    First, convert mixed numbers to improper fractions.     To find the land for corn, multiply the total fraction of the land by the portion of the land for planting corn.  Land for corn   Next, divide the land for corn by the size of each plot to find the number of plots he can plant.  Number of plots   Since dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, then:     Number of plots      Simplify the fraction by dividing through by .     Therefore, number of plots       Combined operations involving three operations  When you are required to perform combined operations involving three operations, carry out operations according to their order.

Share your findings with the rest of learners in the class.           A recurring number , also known as a repeating decimal, is a decimal number in which a specific digit or group of digits after the decimal point repeats without ending.  In recurring decimals, dot notation is used to indicate repeating digits. A dot placed above a specific digit or sequence of digits shows which part repeats. For instance, represents , and represents     Identify whether the following decimals is recurring or non-recurring.                                is recurring because the digit repeats continuously without ending.     is recurring because the digits repeats continuously without ending.     is non recurring because the digits and do not recur.     is recurring because the digits repeats continuously without ending.

Discuss any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.    Share and discuss with other learners about your findings.         In the previous lesson, , we explored recurring decimals . Now, we will learn how to convert recurring decimals into fractions.  To do this, we start by defining the decimal as an unknown variable, say , and label this as equation . Next, we multiply both sides of equation by , where represents the number of repeating digits, and label this as equation . Finally, we subtract equation from equation to eliminate the recurring part and solve for .    Express each of the following as a fraction.                        Step To convert the into a fraction, we let in the expanded form be equal to unkown variable, say, .  Now,   Step : Identify the repeating digits.  In this case we have only one repeating digit which is We therefore multiply both sides of the equation in step by      Step Subtract the result of step from the result of step to eliminate the recurring part.                    Solve for , by dividing both side of the equation by      Therefore,        We equate the recurring decimal to a variable, say , to create equation      Since has two repeating digits, we multiply both sides of equation by so that the recurring digit of the decimals align (this creates equation )     Subtract equation from equation                    Solve for , by dividing both side of the equation by      Simplify the fraction     Therefore,          Rounding off decimal numbers     Work in groups       Using digits create a digit number and write it down on a piece of paper.    Divide the number created in step (b) by .    Round off the resulting number to correct decimal place.    Share and discuss your calculations with the rest of learners in the class.          To round a decimal number to a specified number of decimal places, we examine the digit immediately after the desired decimal place. If this digit is less than , simply remove all subsequent digits. If the digit is or greater, we add to the digit in the desired decimal and eliminate the following digits.    Round off each of the following to one decimal place:                        We first place each digit in its correct place value position.    Number  Tens  Ones  Decimal point  Tenths  Hundredths  Thousandths              To round to one decimal place, we examine the digit in the hundredths place.  The hundredths digit is , which is greater than . Therefore, we add to the tenths digit.  Thus, rounded to one decimal place is .       We first place each digit in its correct place value position.    Number  Ones  Decimal point  Tenths  Hundredths  Thousandths            To round to one decimal place, we examine the digit in the hundredths place.  The hundredths digit is , which is less than . Therefore, we don't add to the tenths digit.  Thus, rounded to one decimal place is .         Round off the following mass in kilograms correct to three decimal places:      kg           kg  We first place each digit in its correct place value position.

The hundred thousandths digit is , which is less than . Therefore, we don't add to the thousandths digit.  Thus, rounded to three decimal place is .         Expressing Numbers to the Required Significant Figures     Work in groups       Consider the following numbers:     Find and identify the significant digits in each of the numbers above.    Express each number in step (a) to significant figures.    Share and discuss your findings with the rest of learners in the class.           Significant figures (or significant digits ) are the digits in a number that contribute to its precision. They include all non-zero digits, any zeros between non-zero digits, and trailing zeros in decimal numbers.        All nonzero digits are significant.    All zeros between nonzero digits are significant.    Leading zeros (to the left of the first nonzero digit) are not significant.    Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal place are significant.    Zero appearing after non-zero digit. On the whole numbers side may be significant or may not be significant figures. It can be a place holder or a significant.       How many significant figures are there in the following masses?      kg     kg     kg     kg           kg  All nonzero digits are significant and zeros between them count as significant.  Thus kg contains five significant digits.     kg  All the zeros that are on the right of the last non-zero digit are significant if they come from a measurement.  Thus kg contains three significant digits.     kg  All the zeros that are on the right of the last non-zero digit, after the decimal point, are significant.  Thus kg contains five significant digits.     kg  Leading zeros are never significant  Thus kg contains two significant digits.         Express each of the following numbers to the given number of significant figures in brackets:                        The number has five significant digits.  To round it off to three significant figures, we consider the fourth significant digit .  The fourth significant digit is , which is greater than  . Therefore, we add to the third significant digit and replace the fourth and fifth significant digits with zeros.  Thus, to three significant figures is .  In this case, zeros serve as placeholders and not significant figures.       The number has four significant digits because the leading zeros are not significant digits.  To round it off to two significant digits, we consider the third significant digit .  The third significant digit is , which is greater than  . Therefore, we add to the second significant digit and we remove the remaining digits.  Thus, correct to significant digit is          Expressing Numbers in Standard Form     Work in groups       Using digits create a digit number and write it down on a piece of paper.    Starting from the digit in the ones place, move steps to the left and insert a decimal point to form a decimal number.    Multiply the decimal number obtained in the previous step by raised to the power of the number of steps moved.    Share your final number in standard form with the rest of learners in your class.           Standard form is a way of representing numbers in a clear and consistent way. A number expressed in the form of , where is an integer and is greater than zero but less than is said to be in standard form.    Express each of the following numbers in standard from:                             To express in standard form, we start by writing the first digit of the number.  The first digit of is . We then place a decimal point after it and write the remaining digits, giving .  Since we moved the decimal point places to the left, we multiply by .  Therefore, the standard form of is .       To express in standard from, we start by identifying the first non-zero digit  The first non-zero digit in is .  Next, we place the decimal point immediately after , giving .  Since we shifted the decimal point places to the right, we express this as an exponent of with base .  Therefore, the standard form of is .       To express in standard form, we begin by identifying the first non-zero digit.  The first non-zero digit in is .  Next, we place the decimal point immediately after , giving .  Since we shifted the decimal point places to the left, we express this as an exponent of with base .  Therefore, the standard form of is .         Combined Operations    Work in groups    Materials Needed: A cm ruler.     Measure the length of an A exercise book in centimeters.    Measure the width of the A exercise book in centimeters.    Measure the length of a pen in centimeters.    Measure the length of the teacher's board in centimeters.    Convert all the measurements from centimeters to meters by dividing each by .    Divide the board’s length in meters by the length of the A exercise book. Multiply the result by the width of the A exercise book. Finally, add the length of the pen to the result.    Share and discuss your findings with the rest of learners in class.          Combined operations on decimals involve performing multiple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within a single expression. We follow the order of brackets, division, multiplication, addition, and finally Subtraction (BODMAS) when working out multiple operations.    Work out each of the following:                        We first perform addition, then subtraction.  We rearrange the operation as   To add decimal numbers, align them vertically.             Then, we perform the subtraction.              Thus,     Given the expression:     Perform the division first.     Express the decimals as fractions and then we multiply the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor:     Now, the expression simplifies to:     Perform the multiplication:     Now, the expression reduces to:     Perform the addition:     subtract from            Use of IT     Explore how to convert fractions to decimals by watching the video below.

  "body": " Algebraic expressions   In Grade 7, we learned how to form and simplify algebraic expressions. In this section, we will explore factorization, simplifying algebraic fractions, and evaluating expressions by substitution. These concepts help us manipulate expressions efficiently, making it easier to solve equations and apply algebra in real-life situations.  For example, when calculating costs of items, distances, or quantities, algebra simplifies complex relationships into manageable expressions.    Factorisation of algebraic expressions   What is Factorisation?   Factorisation is the process of expressing an algebraic expression as a product of its simpler components, making it easier to simplify and solve mathematical problems.  It helps simplify expressions, solve equations efficiently, and understand relationships between quantities. By identifying common factors, we can rewrite algebraic terms in a more structured form, making problem-solving more efficient.   a) Factorization by Finding Common Factors   This method involves identifying the greatest common factor (GCF) in all terms of an expression and factoring it out.    Factorize:     The greatest common factor (GCF) of and is .   divides and to get;        b) Factorization of Algebraic Expressions by Grouping   This technique is useful when an expression has four terms that can be grouped into pairs, each having a common factor.    Factorize     Group the terms (like terms) which look similar     Factor out common terms in each group:     Factor out the common factor         New word; like terms  Like terms are terms that have the same variable and the same power. They can be added or subtracted because they belong to the same group.    Group Activity: Work in groups   Instructions:   Make groups of 3-4 learners.  Make number cards from papers (Manilla or foolscap) e.g [** A photo of paper number cards(different colours) with an expression like , **]  Use the number and variable cards to create algebraic expressions.  Identify the common factor in each expression and rewrite it in factored form.  Discuss your findings with other group members      What patterns did you notice when factorizing expressions?    How does factorization help in solving algebraic problems?       Jose a fruit seller arranges mangoes and bananas in baskets.  Let:      be the number of mangoes in each basket     be the number of bananas in each basket     If there are baskets, write an algebraic expression for the total number of mangoes and bananas.    Mangoes in baskets     Bananas in baskets     Total number of fruits:     Factorizing with we get;          Identify whether the following pairs of terms are like or unlike:      and      and      and      and      and      and      and          Factorize each of the following expressions:                                                  During a tree-planting day at Hope primary School, a grade planted tree seedlings. Factorize the expression representing the number of tree seedlings planted that day by the rade learners.      Salamaa School purchased some books for different classes. If there were books all together, what is the factorized expression representing the number of books the school bought.      An electrician has meters of wire. Factorize the expression to find how the wire can be divided.       Simplifying algebraic fractions  Algebraic fractions are fractions that have algebraic expressions in their numerator, denominator or with them.   Factorization method of simplification   Have you ever shared something equally among friends, like sharing food? When working with algebraic fractions, we apply similar ideas by finding common terms and simplifying them.     Group Activity: Work in groups   What you need: A book or a paper and a pen  A mechanic workshop has two workers, Amani and Baraka. Amani completes of a car repair job in an hour, while Baraka completes of the same job in an hour.  Taking any given letter to represent the total amount of work, find:     How much work do they complete together in one hour?    How do we express this as a simplified algebraic fraction?      Key Takeaway   We can simplify algebraic fractions the same way we simplify numerical fractions     Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)    Rewrite fractions with the same denominator    Combine like terms, then simplify         Simplify the algebraic fraction:       First, we find the LCM of and , which is   Then,we rewrite each fraction,     Then we add the numerators,        Now, we simplify;       Sometimes we simplify fractions with  and sometimes      Simplify the algebraic expression,     Find the LCM of the denominators  The denominators are and , getting   Rewrite each fraction with denominator :     Since the terms are unlike (one has and the other has ), we cannot combine them, therefore having;         Simplify the algebraic fraction:       Here we need to factor out the common factors in the numerator and denominator  The numerator has a common factor of , So:     The denomenator has a common factor of :     Rewriting the fraction in factored forms:     Now the common factor cancels out;     getting,          A farmer employed three workers and paid them , and shillings respectively. Calculate the total amount paid and simplify your answer.      Simplify each of the following expressions:      +      +      +      +                    Shillah is given litres of water in a container and litres in another. He pours all the water into a large tank. Find the total amount of water in the tank and simplify your answer.      The length of a football field is metres by metres. Find its perimeter and simplify your answer.      For a tilling job Jeff, Ham and Steve were paid shillings, shillings and shillings respectively. Calculate the total amount of money they were paid for the tilling work and simplify the answer.      Munene's piece of land has an area of hectares. What is the simplified form of this expression?      Sakina's farm produce of maize in a particular year. Express the amount of maize in its simplest form.      Ministry of education receives shillings from the budgetary board. It spends shillings on digital learning for the classrooms resources. What fraction of its budget is it allocated for digital learning? Simplify your answer.       Evaluating algebraic expressions by substitution  We often deal with formulas and expressions on our day-to-day calculations. For example, calculating the total cost of items, determining the speed of a moving object, or finding the area of a piece of land. These formulas use letters (variables) to represent unknown values. In this section, we will learn how to evaluate algebraic expressions by replacing variables with given numbers.     Bus company charges shillings for a trip to town, where is the number of kilometres travelled. Find the total cost for a trip.    Here we are given =   Therefore,               On a market day at Malava market, the cost of a bunch of  is shillings, a of maize is shillings and a tomato is shillings.  [**Aphoto of a marker with sukuma wiki and maize bag with the price tags**]  Write Expressions when:     Write an algebraic expression for the total cost, when a customer buys bunches of  ,  of maize, and tomato from the market.    Given that a bunch of  goes for shillings, a of maize for shillings and a tomamto for shillings, find the total amount paid by the customer for all the goods bought that day.         Evaluate   where = 5, = 3 and = 7    To solve the question, we need to substitute the values of , and into the expression;   = 5, = 3 and = 7;  So               Key Takeaway      Variables help represent unknown values and changing quantities. How can these tools help in real-life algebra problems?    Substituting values makes it easier to evaluate expressions. Such as using formulas in recipes, calculating transport expenses e.t.c.    Application of algebraic expressions is important in budgeting, farming measurements, business profit calculations and savings planning.           Evaluate the following expressions using the given values:      where, = and = 4     where, = and =      where, = , = and =      where, = , = and =        The area of a triangle is given by . Find when = cm and = cm    The speed, of an object is given by . Find when =     A mobile data plan costs shillings per month. Calculate the cost of the plan when = .     harvests maize based on the area of land used and the number of workers. The total bags of maize harvested last year is given by , where is the land area in acres, and is the number of workers who did the farm work.     Find the total harvest when uses acres of land and employs workers.    If needs bags of maize, how many more acres should she cultivate, assuming she maintain the same number of workers?            "

The cost of one exercise book is Ksh , and a mathematical set costs Ksh . If you have a total of Ksh to spend, how many exercise books can you buy for your school work?  [**A photo of a bookshop(showing shelves behind) with the seller and a student at the counter with a set and some books at the counter**]  In this situation we need to form an equation to determine the number of exercise books. We can represent the number of books as and write the total cost as:     Therefore we can say, a  is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between numbers and an unknown value using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.  Understanding how to form and solve linear equations allows us to make better decisions and solve practical challenges efficiently.    Forming linear equations in one unknown          Forming Linear Equations in Two Unknowns   In many real-life situations, we encounter problems involving two related unknown quantities. When we represent such problems using algebra, we form equations with two variables. These are known as linear equations in two unknowns, often written in the form .  To form such equations, we assign variables to the unknowns, then use the information given to write two related expressions and connect them with an equals sign.    Examples of Forming Linear Equations   Forming equations from money and quantity   A fruit vendor sells oranges at Ksh 10 each and mangoes at Ksh 20 each. On a certain day, she sold a total of 50 fruits worth Ksh 800. Form two linear equations to represent the situation.    Let be the number of oranges and be the number of mangoes.  Equation for total fruits:  Equation for total cost:     Forming equations from age relationships   The sum of Mary and her brother's ages is 30. Mary is 4 years older than her brother. Form linear equations in two unknowns.    Let Mary's age be and her brother's age be .  Equation for total age:  Mary is 4 years older:        A carpenter makes stools and tables. A stool sells for Ksh 500 and a table for Ksh 1,000. On a market day, he sold 10 items and earned Ksh 7,000. Form two equations.      A farmer bought some cows and goats. Each cow costs Ksh 25,000 and each goat Ksh 5,000. He bought 12 animals and spent Ksh 180,000. Form two equations.        A shopkeeper sells pens at Ksh 30 and pencils at Ksh 20. In one day, she sells 40 items and earns Ksh 1,100. Form two linear equations to represent this situation.      A boda boda rider transports passengers and parcels. A passenger trip earns Ksh 100 while a parcel delivery earns Ksh 150. In a day, the rider completes 20 trips and earns Ksh 2,500. Form two equations.      A man has some 100-shilling and 200-shilling notes adding up to Ksh 2,400. Form two equations to represent this.      To form linear equations in two unknowns:  Assign variables to each unknown.  Use the relationships or totals given to form two separate equations.  The equations will typically be solved together using substitution or elimination methods.       Solving linear equations by elimination method          Solving Linear Equations using Substitution Method   The substitution method is used to solve a pair of linear equations in two unknowns. It involves expressing one variable in terms of the other from one equation, and then substituting into the second equation to find the solution.  This method is especially useful when one of the equations is already simplified or one variable has a coefficient of 1.    Examples of Solving Linear Equations   Solving equations using substitution   Solve the following equations using substitution:      Step 1: The first equation is already in terms of : .  Step 2: Substitute into the second equation:     →  Step 3: Substitute back into :   Final Answer: ,     Substitution from a rearranged equation   Solve: and using substitution.    Step 1: Rearrange the first equation to make the subject:   Step 2: Substitute into the second equation:     →  Step 3: Substitute into :   Final Answer: ,      Practice: Solve by Substitution    Solve: and   Solve: and       Note on Choosing Equations for Substitution  When choosing which equation to use for substitution, look for one that is already solved for a variable or can be easily rearranged. This saves time and avoids complex algebra.    To solve equations using substitution:     Make one variable the subject in one of the equations.    Substitute into the second equation.    Solve for one variable, then back-substitute to find the other.    Check your solution by substituting into both original equations.        Solving Linear Equations by graphical Method         "

Discuss and compare result with other groups.          is the interest where the principal keeps changing each year.  The principal of any year is the sum of the principal and the interest of the previous year.   is the total interest earned in all the year.  The difference between the amount derived from accumulated interest and the initial amount is the compound interest.    is calculated only on the original principal, while is calculated on the principal plus accumulated interest, making it grow over time that the principal was deposited.    A trader took a loan of at the rate of compound interest for three year. Find the total amount of interest repaid after three years.                   Therefore,         Akinyi deposited in a bank. The bank paid interest at the rate of per annum. He withdrew all the money at the end of three years.     Calculate the compound interest after the three years.    How much money was in his account by the end of the three years?                                      Appreciation  Appreciation 📈 Appreciation means the increase in value of something over time. For example, if you buy a piece of land for Sh. 5,000 and after a few years it is worth Sh. 7,000. It has then appreciated in value.  Appreciation = Value goes up 🚀    Mogaka bought a piece of land at Ksh. 250,000 in Sirare. He practised cash crop farming. After 5 years the area developed due to construction of schools, roads and hosptals. Mogaka sold the piece of land at Ksh. 750,000.  What could have caused the change in the price of money?  List examples of items that appreciate in value over time?     Listen carefully to the role play below.  What you require, someone to read for you this conversation as you internalize on what it talks about.      Good morning Mr. Kavai?  Good morning Nyali how are you?     I'm fairing on well.  We thank God for the gift of life.     Yeah. How much money did you spend in constructing this magnificient house?  I spent 1.2 million including purchasing the piece of land.     How do you intend to pay back that some of money you spent?  I'm planning to rent the smaller apartments for Ksh. 50,000 per month.     Wow that's a brilliant idea.  Sure that's why I invested in building it. Besides I will not be rentimmg I'l be staying in this house.     I have also noticed that the value of property in this area appreciates at 10% per annum due to prescence of social amenities. So maybe some later time you can sell the house and recover the money you spent constructing the house and earn a profit.   That's a brilliant idea. I'll think about it .     From the conversation, calculate the value of the house in 3 years?     A plot of land's value in 2020 was at Sh. 1 200 000. The value of the plot ppreciated at a rate of 10% per annum in the first year, 12% per annum in the second year, 15% per annum in the third year, 20% per annum in the forth year and 25% in the fifth year. Calculate the value of the land at the end of the 5th year.    Value after Appreciation = principal + (rate principal)           Depreciation  Depreciation 📉 Depreciation is the decrease in value of something over time. For example, if you buy a car for Ksh. 10,000 and after a few years it is worth only Ksh. 6,000, it has depreciated in value.  Depreciation = Value goes down 📉    A car is purchased for Ksh.720,000. It is assumed to depreciate by 25% in the 1st and 2nd year, 20% in the third and fourth year and 15% in each of the 5th and above years. Calculate the value of the car after 6 years      What are some of the items that you whose value depreciates after sometime?    Diera bought a phone at Ksh. 14,500.Two years later, the Company released an updated model of the phone and she sold the phone at a lower price and added some cash to buy the latest model of the phone. The phone was depreciating at the rate of 25% annually.    Why do you think Diera sold her phone at a lower price than she boight it?    Calculate the value of the phone at the end of the first year.    Calculate the value of the phone at the end of the second year.    Calculate the value of the phone at the end of the third year if Diera could have sold it.        A factory is valued at Sh.120,000 for the building and Sh.60,000 for the machinery. If the building appreciates by 5% p.a. and the machinery depreciates by 8% p.a., calculate the total value of the buildings and machinery after 5 years.           Hire purchase  Visit a nearby Electronic or general shop with your teacher or quardian or parent and ask for prices of different Items when bought with cash money and also when purchased by paying a small deposit and paying the rest of the remaining funds monthly according to agreed terms and conditions. What do you notice?    Consider a motorist buying a Motorcycle at Ksh. 150,000 on hire purhase terms. He pays a deposit of Sh.40,000 and the remaining money will be paid by monthly instalments of 10,500 for 10 months. What was the total cost of the Motorcycle?  Identify the cashprice of the Motorcycle.  Calculate the total amount the motorist paid for the vehicle.  How much money could have been saved if the Motorist bought the motorcycle with cash?  Discuss with your friends 3 advantages and 3 disadvantages of buying items in hire purchase terms.      The cash price of a rectangular water storage tank was Ksh. 120,000. Kerubo paid a deposit of Ksh. 30,000 and 12 monthly instalments of Ksh.9,000 per month.  (a) Calculate the hire purchase price.  (b) Calculate the deposit if he could have paid monthly instalments of Ksh. 15,000 for 6 months.  (c) How much more money did Kerubo pay in Hire purchase than cash price?     "

Assesment Rubric    Criteria  Excellent (3)       Assessment Rubric (Sample)    Criteria  Excellent (3)  Good (2)  Needs Support (1)    Accurate unit conversion  ✔️  ✔️  ❌    Ratio form is correct  ✔️  ✔️  ❌    Mathematical explanation clear  ✔️  ✔️  ❌    Team collaboration  ✔️  ✔️  ❌        Conversion of Linear Scales to Ratio Form     Chart paper\/whiteboards for group work, Rulers, Printed maps or handouts with linear scales (or drawn on the board), Worksheet (provided below) and Calculators (optional)    Think-Pair-Share, Discuss in pairs.  (a) If 1 cm on a map represents 4 km in real life, how far is 3 cm? How can we write this relationship in a simpler, universal form?  (b) We can write this using a ratio scale—it’s a way to show the map-to-real-life relationship without using units. But we must first make sure both sides use the same unit.    Statement: If 1 cm represents 2.5 km  Convert 2.5 km to cm  2.5 km = 2.5 × 1000 × 100 = 250,000 cm    Write the ratio → since 1 cm = 250,000 cm, then our ratio will be:  1 : 250,000     km to cm = × 100,000, m to cm = ×100      Your group is city planners designing the layout for a new map of Greenfield. The map says: 1 cm represents 3.2 km. Convert this into a ratio scale and explain what it means.     Ratio = 1:320,000  This means that for every 1 cm on the map, the real-world distance is 3.2 km. So a short distance on paper can represent a long trip in real life.      Conversion of Linear Scales to Statement Form    Rulers, Printed maps or handouts with linear scales (or drawn on the board), Worksheet (provided below) and Calculators (optional)     Take a sample linear scale like the one shown below.  (a) A line labeled: 0 ————|—————|—————|———— 100 km   (Each division is 1 cm apart)   (b) Measure the distance between 0 and 100 km using a ruler.    Interpret the Scale     Write the Statement Scale.  So the statement scale is         a) A map shows that 3 cm = 90 km. What is the scale in statement form  b) A map shows that 5 cm = 200 km. What is the scale in statement form     1 cm = 30 km → Statement scale: 1 cm represents 30 km   1 cm = 40 km → Statement scale: 1 cm represents 40 km      John is planning a road trip using a printed map. On the map, the distance between City A and City B is 7.5 cm. The linear scale on the map shows that 2.5 cm represents 50 km.  a. Convert the linear scale to a statement scale.  b. How far is the actual distance between City A and City B?  c. If John drives at an average speed of 75 km\/h, how long will it take him to travel from City A to City B?    a. Convert the ratio scale to a statement scale In ratio 1:20, the statement scale: 1 cm represents 20 km  b. To find the actual distance between City A and City B, we can use the statement scale we just calculated. The actual distance between City A and City B is 150 km.  c. To find the time it will take John to travel from City A to City B, we can use the formula: It will take John 2 hours to travel from City A to City B.

  "body": " Data Presentation and Interpretation    - is the process of arranging and presenting data in a way that makes it simple to comprehend and analyze. Diagrams, tables, charts, graphs and other visual formats can be used for this. Patterns, trends, and relationships in the data are easier to spot when they are properly represented.   - is the method for evaluating the represented data in order to derive significant findings. It involves understanding what the data indicates, spotting patterns and drawing well-informed conclusions from the results.    Drawing Bar Graphs of Data        Ask and record the number of members of your class, born in the months of January, February, March, April, May, and June.  Fill in the table shown.    Month  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun    No. of members                 Choose a suitable scale and represent the data on a bar graph.  Compare and discuss your graphs with other groups.        A bar graph is the display of information using rectangles of uniform width. The length of each rectangle represents the frequency.  Bars can be displayed either vertically or horizontally and are used to compare different categories or groups.    The following table shows the number of learners who received different grades in an exam:    Grade  Number of Learners    5  45    6  30    7  35    8  30    9  40    Choose a suitable scale and represent the data on a bar graph.    Choosing a suitable scale for the length of bars, for example 1cm representing 10 learner, the graph is drawn as shown.              Collect data in your class about the ages of students and represent it using a bar graph    Discuss how the data you have collected is usefull.        Interpreting Bar Graphs of Data      A teacher surveyed a class of students about their favorite colors. The results are shown in the bar graph below.        Which color was chosen by the highest number of learners?    How many learners selected Green as their preferred color?    What is the difference in the number of learners who chose Blue and those who chose Yellow?    What is the total number of learners represented in the graph?    What percentage of the total learners preferred the color Red?         The scale that is chosen, the width of the bars, and the length of the bars all provide information that is represented by a bar graph.    Mama Karisa went to Shinyalu market to buy fruits and placed them in a basket. The fruits were: Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Grapes, Mangoes, Pineapples, Passion and Avocado. A bar graph representing the information is given below. Use the information from the bar graph to answer the questions.        Which fruit appears the most in the basket?    How many oranges are in the basket?    What is the difference between the number of apples and mangoes?    What is the total number of fruits in the basket?    Are there any fruits with the same quantity?    How many more bananas would be needed to match the number of apples?    If 10 apples and 5 oranges were removed, how many fruits would be left?    How many more bananas and oranges are there than grapes and avocados?          Compare all the given numbers in the fruits and see which is highest  Apples = are the most common fruit.    Check the number of oranges in the graph  there are oranges    Apples =   Mangoes =   Find the difference =   There are more apples than mangoes.    Add all the quantities together:     The total number of fruits in the basket is .    Check for equal number of fruits  answer is NO    Apples =   Bananas =   Difference =    more bananas are needed to match the apples.    Apples = so Apples left =   Oranges = so Oranges left =   New total:   After removing some fruits, fruits remain.    Bananas + Oranges =   Grapes + Avocados =   Difference =   There are more bananas and oranges than grapes and avocados.         Drawing Line Graphs of Data of given Data      The table below shows Muthoni's math test scores throughout the year:    Month  January  March  May  July  September  November    Test Score  75%  80%  85%  90%  88%  92%    Represent the information on a line graph   Plot the months on the x-axis and the test scores on the y-axis.    Connect the points with a line to show the trend.    Discuss.         A line graph is a type of chart used to display information that changes over time. It consists of a horizontal (x-axis) and a vertical (y-axis), with data points connected by a line to show trends, patterns, and variations in data.    The table below shows the average temperature (in °C) in Kathonzweni over six months     January  February  March  April  May  June     5°C  10°C  15°C  20°C  20°C  25°C    Draw a line graph to represent this data.    Vertical Scale is 1 cm represents 5°C and Horizontal Scale is 1 cm represents one month         Interpreting Line Graphs of Data      Consider the graph below that shows the journey Wakavinye took from home to school        How far from home was Wakavinye after 10 minutes?    What was the total distance traveled after 30 minutes?    How many kilometers did the Wakavinye travel between 15 and 20 minutes?    What does the flat section of the graph represent?            In line graphs, points are connected with straight lines to represent changes in values overal period of time.    Line graphs can be interpreted to obtain required relevant information       A group of students conducted an experiment to observe how the temperature of water changes over time when heated. They recorded the temperature at different time intervals and plotted their results on a graph.        What was the temperature at 0 minutes?    How long did it take for the temperature to reach 0°C?    During which time interval did the temperature stay constant?    At what time did the temperature first reach 100°C?    How many degrees did the temperature increase between 0 and 20 minutes?    What does the flat section of the graph after 20 minutes indicate?    If the trend continued beyond 25 minutes, what might happen to the temperature?          From the graph,check the temperature at minutes which was     The temperature started at and reached at minutes.    From the graph, the temperature remained at from minutes to minutes.  The temperature also stayed at from minutes to minutes.    From the graph, the water temperature reached at minutes.    At minutes, the temperature was .  At minutes, the temperature was .  Increase in temperature =     A flat section on a temperature-time graph means the temperature is not changing.  The flat section after minutes indicates that the water has reached its boiling point and is turning into steam.    If the heat source remains, the water will continue to boil.  The temperature will stay at until the water completely evaporates.         A bus and a car are traveling along the same route. Their distances from the starting point are recorded at different times in a 24-hour format and plotted on the graph. The graph shows when each vehicle was moving and when they took breaks.        At what time did the bus start its journey?    At what time did the car start its journey?    What was the average speed of the car from 12:00 to 14:00?    What was the speed of the bus between 13:00 and 17:00?    How far had the bus traveled by 12:00?    Between which times did the bus remain at the same distance?    At what time did the car take a break?    At what time did both the bus and the car reach 400 km?    Which vehicle reached 500 km first?

Identifying the Mode of a Set of Discrete Data      A mathematics teacher at Mukumu secondary school gave a short quiz to a class of 40 students, and these are their scores           Count how many times each score appears.    Find the most frequent one    Compare your answer with others in class         The mode of a data set is the value that appears most frequently.    A shoe store recorded the shoe sizes of 30 customers who bought shoes. The sizes are:        Create a frequency table for the shoe sizes.  Find the mode of the data set.      Shoe Size  Tally  Frequency    38  ||||  4    39  |||||  5    40  ||||| ||  7    41  ||||| |  6    The mode of the data is       Calculating the Mean of a Set of Discrete Data      A teacher recorded the ages of 45 students in a school. The ages are:              Find the mean age of the students.    Explain what the mean represents in this case.         The mean also known as average of a data set is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values.  Formula for Mean is given by:       A farmer recorded the number of oranges picked from trees in his orchard. The number of apples picked from each tree is:           Find the mean number of oranges picked per tree.    Add all the apple counts                       Divide by the total number of trees      The mean number of apples picked per tree is .      Determining the Median of a Set of Discrete Data      Taita secondary school football team coach recorded the heights (in cm) of players on the team:           Find the median height of the players.    Explain what the median represents in this scenario         The item in the middle is the median when the items in a data set are sorted in ascending order.    A bakery recorded the number of loaves of bread sold each day for days. The numbers are:        Find the median number of loaves sold per day.    Arrange the data in ascending order        Find the middle values   Since there are values (even number), the median is the average of the and values.     value =      value =         The median number of loaves sold per day is .            Collect data on the different ages of students in your class  Determine the median age    Record the number of students arriving late in class each day for 5 school days   Find the median number of students arriving late per day.    Explain what the median represents in this scenario.           "

Events can be classified as likely, unlikely, certain (must happen), or impossible (cannot happen).       In a classroom of 40 students, the teacher randomly selects one student to answer a question. Identify an event that is likely,unlikely, must happen and cannot happen.     The chosen student has a pencil.    The chosen student is left-handed.    The teacher will select a student.    The teacher picks a student who is not in the class.          Likely: Most students bring a pencil to class, so this is more likely to happen.    Unlikely: Some students may be left-handed, but the majority are right-handed, making this event less likely.    Must happen: The teacher must choose someone, so this will definitely happen.

Discuss and share with other groups            Probability can be expressed as a percentage to show how likely an event is to occur. A probability percentage tells us the chance of an event happening out of 100.     A probability of % means the event cannot happen.    An event with a probability of % has an equal chance of occurring or not occurring.    A probability of % means the event will definitely happen.    The total probability of all possible outcomes always adds up to %          Suppose you roll a die times and the number appears times.

  "body": "  Nanjala rolled a number cube times and got an even number times. Predict how many times she might get an even number if she rolls the cube times.    From the experiment:  Nanjala rolled the number cube times.  She got an even number times.  So, the experimental probability of getting an even number is:     To predict how many times Nanjala might get an even number in rolls, we multiply the experimental probability by .     Therefore, Nanjala might get an even number times if she rolls the number cube times.   "
