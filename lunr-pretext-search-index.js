  "body": " Algebraic expressions   In Grade 7, we learned how to form and simplify algebraic expressions. In this section, we will explore factorization, simplifying algebraic fractions, and evaluating expressions by substitution. These concepts help us manipulate expressions efficiently, making it easier to solve equations and apply algebra in real-life situations.  For example, when calculating costs of items, distances, or quantities, algebra simplifies complex relationships into manageable expressions.    Factorisation of algebraic expressions   What is Factorization?   Factorization is the process of expressing an algebraic expression as a product of its simpler components, making it easier to simplify and solve mathematical problems.  It helps simplify expressions, solve equations efficiently, and understand relationships between quantities. By identifying common factors, we can rewrite algebraic terms in a more structured form, making problem-solving more efficient.   a) Factorization by Finding Common Factors   This method involves identifying the greatest common factor (GCF) in all terms of an expression and factoring it out.    Factorize:     The greatest common factor (GCF) of and is .   divides and to get;        b) Factorization of Algebraic Expressions by Grouping   This technique is useful when an expression has four terms that can be grouped into pairs, each having a common factor.    Factorize     Group the terms (like terms) which look similar     Factor out common terms in each group:     Factor out the common factor         New word; like terms  Like terms are terms that have the same variable and the same power. They can be added or subtracted because they belong to the same group.    Group Activity: Work in groups   Instructions:   Make groups of 3-4 learners.  Make number cards from papers (Manilla or foolscap) e.g [** A photo of paper number cards(different colours) with an expression like , **]  Use the number and variable cards to create algebraic expressions.  Identify the common factor in each expression and rewrite it in factored form.  Discuss your findings with other group members      What patterns did you notice when factorizing expressions?    How does factorization help in solving algebraic problems?       Jose a fruit seller arranges mangoes and bananas in baskets.  Let:      be the number of mangoes in each basket     be the number of bananas in each basket     If there are baskets, write an algebraic expression for the total number of mangoes and bananas.    Mangoes in baskets     Bananas in baskets     Total number of fruits:     Factorizing with we get;          Identify whether the following pairs of terms are like or unlike:      and      and      and      and      and      and      and          Factorize each of the following expressions:                                                  During a tree-planting day at Hope primary School, a grade planted tree seedlings. Factorize the expression representing the number of tree seedlings planted that day by the rade learners.      Salamaa School purchased some books for different classes. If there were books all together, what is the factorized expression representing the number of books the school bought.      An electrician has meters of wire. Factorize the expression to find how the wire can be divided.       Simplifying algebraic fractions  Algebraic fractions are fractions that have algebraic expressions in their numerator, denominator or with them.   Factorization method of simplification   Have you ever shared something equally among friends, like sharing food? When working with algebraic fractions, we apply similar ideas by finding common terms and simplifying them.     Group Activity: Work in groups   What you need: A book or a paper and a pen  A mechanic workshop has two workers, Amani and Baraka. Amani completes of a car repair job in an hour, while Baraka completes of the same job in an hour.  Taking any given letter to represent the total amount of work, find:     How much work do they complete together in one hour?    How do we express this as a simplified algebraic fraction?      Key Takeaway   We can simplify algebraic fractions the same way we simplify numerical fractions     Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)    Rewrite fractions with the same denominator    Combine like terms, then simplify         Simplify the algebraic fraction:       First, we find the LCM of and , which is   Then,we rewrite each fraction,     Then we add the numerators,        Now, we simplify;       Sometimes we simplify fractions with  and sometimes      Simplify the algebraic expression,     Find the LCM of the denominators  The denominators are and , getting   Rewrite each fraction with denominator :     Since the terms are unlike (one has and the other has ), we cannot combine them, therefore having;         Simplify the algebraic fraction:       Here we need to factor out the common factors in the numerator and denominator  The numerator has a common factor of , So:     The denomenator has a common factor of :     Rewriting the fraction in factored forms:     Now the common factor cancels out;     getting,          A farmer employed three workers and paid them , and shillings respectively. Calculate the total amount paid and simplify your answer.      Simplify each of the following expressions:      +      +      +      +                    Shillah is given litres of water in a container and litres in another. He pours all the water into a large tank. Find the total amount of water in the tank and simplify your answer.      The length of a football field is metres by metres. Find its perimeter and simplify your answer.      For a tilling job Jeff, Ham and Steve were paid shillings, shillings and shillings respectively. Calculate the total amount of money they were paid for the tilling work and simplify the answer.      Munene's piece of land has an area of hectares. What is the simplified form of this expression?      Sakina's farm produce of maize in a particular year. Express the amount of maize in its simplest form.      Ministry of education receives shillings from the budgetary board. It spends shillings on digital learning for the classrooms resources. What fraction of its budget is it allocated for digital learning? Simplify your answer.       Evaluating algebraic expressions by substitution  We often deal with formulas and expressions on our day-to-day calculations. For example, calculating the total cost of items, determining the speed of a moving object, or finding the area of a piece of land. These formulas use letters (variables) to represent unknown values. In this section, we will learn how to evaluate algebraic expressions by replacing variables with given numbers.     Bus company charges shillings for a trip to town, where is the number of kilometres travelled. Find the total cost for a trip.    Here we are given =   Therefore,               On a market day at Malava market, the cost of a bunch of  is shillings, a of maize is shillings and a tomato is shillings.  [**Aphoto of a marker with sukuma wiki and maize bag with the price tags**]  Write Expressions when:     Write an algebraic expression for the total cost, when a customer buys bunches of  ,  of maize, and tomato from the market.    Given that a bunch of  goes for shillings, a of maize for shillings and a tomamto for shillings, find the total amount paid by the customer for all the goods.         Evaluate   where = 5, = 3 and = 7    To solve the question, we need to substitute the values of , and into the expression;   = 5, = 3 and = 7;  So               Key Takeaway      Variables help represent unknown values and changing quantities. How can these tools help in real-life algebra problems?    Substituting values makes it easier to evaluate expressions. Such as using formulas in recipes, calculating transport expenses e.t.c.    Application of algebraic expressions is important in budgeting, farming measurements, business profit calculations and savings planning.           Evaluate the following expressions using the given values:      where, = and = 4     where, = and =      where, = , = and =      where, = , = and =        The area of a triangle is given by . Find when = cm and = cm    The speed, of an object is given by . Find when =     A mobile data plan costs shillings per month. Calculate the cost of the plan when = .     harvests maize based on the area of land used and the number of workers. The total bags of maize harvested last year is given by , where is the land area in acres, and is the number of workers who did the farm work.     Find the total harvest when uses acres of land and employs workers.    If needs bags of maize, how many more acres should she cultivate, assuming she maintain the same number of workers?            "

The cost of one exercise book is Ksh , and a mathematical set costs Ksh . If you have a total of Ksh to spend, how many exercise books can you buy for your school work?  [**A photo of a bookshop(showing shelves behind) with the seller and a student at the counter with a set and some books at the counter**]  In this situation we need to form an equation to determine the number of exercise books. We can represent the number of books as and write the total cost as:     Therefore we can say, a  is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between numbers and an unknown value using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.  Understanding how to form and solve linear equations allows us to make better decisions and solve practical challenges efficiently.   "
